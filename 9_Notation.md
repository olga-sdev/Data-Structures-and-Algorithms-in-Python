#### Asymptonic Notation

Speed of algorithm (number of iterations) with a help of while loop and counter:

```python
def algorithm_speed(n):
  counter = 0
  while n > 1:
    n -= 1
    counter += 1
  return counter

print(algorithm_speed(10))  # 9
```


_Queue_ -> based on FIFO: takes _O(1)_ runtime to retrieve the 1st item in a Queue;

_Stack_ -> based on FILO: takes _O(N)_ runtime to retrive the 1st value in Stack;
