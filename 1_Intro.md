#### Into: Data Structures and Algorithms

Foundation of programm are:
* data;
* algorithms.

_Data Structures_

The way to store and retrieve data -> data structures (examples: lists and arrays, dictionaries).

Functions:
* Inputting information -> type of data, place of data insert, create/update/remove data;
* Processing information -> concurrently/result of process;
* Maintaining information -> relation between partitions of data / memory usage;
* Retrieving information -> return data.

Selecting relevant data structure helps faster and responsive code. Decide the next problems:

* purpose for the data: built-in functionality or implement own for searching, sorting, or iterate data in a better/faster way;
* memory control: static (fixed ammount) memory allocation (e.g., stacks or arrays); dynamic (within the life of the program) memory allocation (e.g., heaps or linked lists).
* runtime - the time when a program is running after being compiled and launched.

_Algorithms_ -> instructions that the computer follows to carry out tasks:
* Sorting algorithms;
* Search algorithms;
* Divide and conquer algorithms;
* Greedy algorithms;
* Brute force algorithms.

Data structures -> maintaining and storing data.
Algorithms -> instructions to utilize/leverage data.

_Dictionary_ -> data _structure_;
_Searching_ data in dictionary -> _algorithm_.
